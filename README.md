Things  ⺌﹐ :b_~9:   I am a very introverted person and tend not to be social in the slightest. Please expect some awkwardness the first time you talk to me, as I'm not used to new people talking to me. Don't let that demotivate you though; you can approach me and have a chat, I personally don't mind it at all, I'm just a bit socially awkward, unless I have a friend there that I know, I might be more talkative !

PS. : check my socials to see my artwork and videos !! 🍒
